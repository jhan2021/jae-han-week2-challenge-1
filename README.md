Jae Han's Portfolio Page

Description:
This repository contains the HTML and CSS file as well as the images used to create my portfolio page. 

The page contains my name, an 'About Me' section, a 'Work' section, and my contact info. 
Note: The 'Work' section has yet to be updated with any website applications.

A screenshot of a preview of the website is provided alongside the README.md file.
